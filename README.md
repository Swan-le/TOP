The Odin Project

Hello world,
This is the first edition into my world of coding. My plan is to push all my learnings and projects to github to show the progression that I've made.

My goal is to land a job in the industry in 2 years. Hopefully by then I'll have a few real world experiences under my belt and i'll already be working on my project.

What's the Project?

Well for years I've been working in the events industy, all that time I've seen companies forcfully use CRM's that aren't made for that industry, my goal is to create an all in one scheduling, planning, financial CRM for event companies to use at scale.

Or i'll make a POS system for best bars... Or maybe I redefine Healthcare Claims processing and CPT / Diagnostics code... We'll see
